** Richardson Maturity Model

* A way to grade your API according to the constraints of REST

* Level 0
- Expose soap web services in rest style
- http://server/getPosts
- http://server/deletePosts

* Level 1
- Expose resources with proper uri
- http://server/account
- http://server/account/10
- note: improper use of http methods

* level 2
- level1 + HTTP methods

* level 3
- level 2 + HATEOAS
- DATA + next possible action

** REST API 설계 시 고려해야할 사항
* consume first
* make best use of http
* request methods(get, post, put, delete)
* response status(200, 201, 400, 401, 404)
* no secure info in URI
* use plurals(복수형태의 사용) (prefer /users to /user, prefer /users/1 to /user/1)
* user nouns for resources (명사 사용)
* for exceptions - define a consistent approach
ex) /search
ex) PUT /lkj/{id}/star
ex) DELETE /lkj/{id}/star
